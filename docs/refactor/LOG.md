## 2026-07-30 — Phase A (orient, baseline, clarify) + scaffold
- Bootstrap: no prior `docs/refactor/STATE.md` → **new engagement**. Repo on
  `claude/repository-refactor-project-5zikwd` == `master` == `origin/master` @ `b1e3004` (0 divergence).
- Tooling: node 22.22.2, pnpm 9.15.9. `gh`/`cloc`/`tokei`/`madge` absent (use GitHub MCP for PRs;
  install cloc/madge in Phase B). `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` OK (595 pkgs, lockfile untouched).
- **Baseline green bar** (all exit 0): build, typecheck, lint, test (206 files / 2017 tests, ~156s;
  QD headless node-suite ~128s of that). No pre-existing failures recorded. The `getContext` /
  `Worker unavailable` lines in the test log are handled jsdom/worker fallbacks, not failures.
- **Scale correction:** prompt states ~30k lines; actual ~122k total / ~84k non-test code across 616
  files. QD ~66% of code and untyped `.mjs`.
- **Discovered prior engagements:** whole-codebase review 2026-07-25 (112 findings, HIGHs fixed, ~48
  open) and a closed algebra-maturity review (`docs/algebra-review/`, merged as PR #81 + follow-ons).
- **Deferred** creating `refactor/main` + scaffold by one turn to resolve the branch-model conflict
  first (prompt's `refactor/main` vs the session's designated `claude/…` branch).
- Asked 4 structured + 3 prose questions. **Answers:** (1) branch model = follow prompt (refactor/main);
  (2) altitude = fresh architectural review; (3) pain = QD internal structure + testability/dev-loop +
  clarity/onboarding (cross-app extraction NOT selected); (4) appetite = deeper redesign where warranted.
  Recorded in PLAN.md v0 §4.
- Created `refactor/main` from `master`; scaffolded `docs/refactor/{STATE,PLAN,ASSESSMENT,LOG,ISSUES}.md`;
  committed to `refactor/main`. Next: Phase B breadth pass. Will STOP before Phase C per user request.
